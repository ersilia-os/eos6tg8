    "Title": "Natural product fingerprint",
    "Description": "The model uses a combination of two multilayer perceptron networks (baseline and auxiliar) and an autoencoder-like network to extract natural-product specific fingerprints that outperform traditional methods for molecular representation. The training sets correspond to the coconut database (NP) and the Zinc database (synthetic). ",
